# PortfolioProjects
Here you will find a compilation of the different projects I've worked on. My purpose for creating this page is to showcase my abilities with various tools and programs to potential employers. These include a variety of projects that deal with SQL, Tableau, Excel, and more. It's true that I do not have any prior job experience in the field, but I hope that my portfolio will be a good starting point to show I know the skills that I claim I have. Please note that this is simply the code for each project, I go more in-depth on these on my website, link on the home page
