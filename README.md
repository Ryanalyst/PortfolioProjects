# PortfolioProjects
Here you will find a compilation of my different projects I've worked on. My purpose for creating them is to showcase my abilities with various tools and programs to potential employers. These include a variety of projects that deal with SQL, Tableau, Excel, and more. It's true that I do not have any prior job experience in the field, but it is my hope that my portfolio will be a good starting point to show I know the skills that I claim I do.
